## Supported Versions

Currently this isn't even versioned at the moment. So... all of them?

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please reports all non-critical security issues via an issue on the repo.
If this ever becomes popular enough to need a private-disclosure method
I'm going to be estatic and tell people to email me using PGP or something.

If you do report something nasty I'll be getting back to you as soon as
possible. If it's less nasty, probably still be excited to have contributions
and I'll get back to you quick anyways.
